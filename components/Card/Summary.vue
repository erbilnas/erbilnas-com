  `Introducing myself is always a challenge, but here's a brief glimpse into who I am: I'm a software engineer, constantly learning and passionate about building my future with zeros and ones. I'm ${age.value} years old, born and raised in Turkey. In terms of appearance, I'm of average height and slightly leaner than
    most. You'll usually find me sporting short hair and a beard, and on
    sunny days, I'll have sunglasses on due to an eye issueâ€”those sun rays
    are no friend of mine. My love for computer technologies, software, and video games dates
    back to my childhood, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in
    software engineering. While I may not be the most social person, those
    close to me know that I can be quite chatty when discussing topics I'm
    passionate about. ^_^ As for my inner world, others have described me as intelligent,
    sophisticated, cultured, dignified, gentle, calm, and humble. While I
    appreciate these positive qualities, I'm more focused on doing what's
    right rather than being perceived as good or bad. I hope this brief introduction gives you a glimpse into who I am. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Take care and stay safe!`
